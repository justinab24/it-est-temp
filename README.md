# it-est-temp

This estimation template serves to calculate the total cost and time needed for I.T projects

HOW IT WORKS:
  
  An admin can login and predefine components and roles
    
      With components, the admin can specify the name, rate, and how much time is needed to build them for different complexities (ie. low, medium, high)
      
      With roles, the admin can specify the name and the rate
      
  After an admin has predefined this data, a user can now use the template:
  
  The user can now add a component by picking one from a list, giving it a description, the complexity they'd like to build, the count, as well as the role they'd like to assign to it
  
  After the user is done adding their components, the template will display the total cost and total hours
  
  If the user would like a breakdown of their inputs and the individual cost and time of them, the template also offers that
